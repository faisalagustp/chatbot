                    <div class="collapsible-header">i'm not motivated to learn and also lacking access to quality education. What should I do?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body">
                        <p>In fact, it's not only you who have lack of access to quality education. Based on UNESCO report, more that 262 million kids around the world can't go to school and more than 600 million kids are going to school, but the education is not effective enough.</p>
                        <p>Currently, SolveEducation, a non-profit organization that is focused on this field, is currently trying to help those kids to stay motivated to learn. The approach that we use for this is "fun learning", since we believe that the main of education is to become a lifelong learner and "fun learning" can improve the internal motivation of learners.</p>
                        <p>One fo our user, Ahmad, is a drop-out since he need to support his family financially. At that moment, he is not having big motivation to learn since he needs to be focused on his family. But we're trying to reach him, and ask him to play our "fun game" named "Dawn of Civilization" (now on Google PlayStore). He is only spending time for 5 times a week, and for about 15 minutes each.</p>
                        <p>Right now, he is already improving his english skill by improving for about three proficiency level, and currently taking an online course scholarship provided by us to learn programming.</p>
                        <p>There will always be a chance if you want to give it a try.</p>
                        <p>Currently we're trying to create a chatbot to help you learn anything you want. As for the initial, we're focusing to create one that is focused on basic english course. By using chatbot, you only need to use your own chat tools (e.g. Whatsapp/Telegram/Line/etc) and you can learn everywhere and anytime independently. Also, the learning process is more "fun" and you will think that you are playing instead of learning.</p>
                        <p>We hope that this can motivate you to learn more and more, and as the "gate opening" to any other opportunity, to improve your quality of life.</p>

                <li>
                    <div class="collapsible-header">I'm not motivated to learn but can go to school/afford to access any alternative education. What should I do?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body">
                        <p>It's okay to not really motivated to learn, sometimes. But you are lucky that you have a privilege to go to school or access any alternative education. In fact, based on UNESCO report, 262 million kids globally are not going to school or any alternative education.</p>
                        <p>But I think you can take your time, and thinking and evaluate yourself, on why you are not motivated to learn. Is it because of the social pressure, the teacher' teaching methodology, or because of the learning process is not fun?</p>
                        <p>If you think that the problem is because of the boring teaching method or you don't feel the "fun" in learning, you can give a try to our chatbot. The chatbot is currently focusing on teaching basic literacy in english, and in future, you can learn anything from our external partner.</p>
                        <p>The chatbot rule in your learning is to improve your internal motivation since it's the basic foundation of learning. This chatbot is also will treat you differently with the other learner, and give you a personalized learning treatment.</p>
                        <p>However, you should not stop on this. You may need to ask your teacher/facilitator to help you to improve your motivation to learn. It's okay to not really motivated. but you also need to think about what's next for your journey of life.</p>

                        <p>Currently, we're trying to create a new digital platform: a chatbot. These are the goals of the usage of chatbot for learning:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>The learning engagement and motivation</strong>
                                <p>Multiple research shows that "fun" in learning is increasing the engagement and motivation to learn. These are important point so their learning process would be more effective and also helps them as a lifelong learner.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Improving student' language ability on reading and writing</strong>
                                <p>By utilizing chatbot, like it or not, the students will use their language ability such as reading and writing skill when communicating with the bot. And some research also found that some students use the chatbot to express their language ability confidently.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Personalized Learning</strong>
                                <p>The disadvantage of classroom setting learning is you giving the same treatment to all of the student in the same classroom. By using a chatbot in a personal mode, the learning experience that the learner is personalized based on their ability and condition.However, personalized learning is not always the good solution since it's minimize social interaction between peers. We can set up the chatbot in a group/chatgroup settings so they can learn together and also keeping the social interaction</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Becoming a learning analytics platform</strong>
                                <p>The good things from utilizing chatbot is we can get the data of student's learning activities without them even realized. However, a good chatbot is asking a consent first to your student that they will capture their learning activities.</p>
                                <p>This data is important so teacher can understand the learning condition of all of the students, personally, so every personalized treatment would be effective.</p>

                    <div class="collapsible-header">Why learning should be fun?</div>

                        <p>
                            Sometimes, we think that education and learning should be a rigorous and intense process to make no one left behind. Based on tens of empirical research, that process does nothing positive to the learner, and it makes them go away from wanting to learn or even dropping out from learning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's our responsibility as the educator to making sure that no one left behind, but also pay attention to learning sustainability. We need to change our goal of the learning process, not only focusing on the hard skills but also engage them to learn more independently. By using this approach, it's scientifically proven that the learner' motivation to learn would be improved.
                        </p>

                    <div class="collapsible-header">Why chatbot?</div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body">
                        <p>A chatbot is not the only way to make your student more engaged in the learning process. There are many other options to make learning fun. Using chatbot is one of those options.</p>
                        <p>But here is a thing. Right now, the penetration of internet is growing, and more people have a or more smartphones. More and more people, including your learners/students, are using a smartphone to help their daily activities. This trend is also happening in chatting apps.</p>
                        <p>[show chart of chat app users]</p>
                        <p>Based on this, since your learner is already adapting to use chat platform, it's easier to shift their focus to start learning using it. So the next phase is how to get a good quality chatbot for your learner.</p>

                    <div class="collapsible-body">
                        <p>So every implementation of educational technology tools needs a strategy to avoid side effect like an addiction. Some of the best practice tells us that using time limitation (e.g. the chatbot is only available at a specific time range) would help the learner to focus on learning and also an excellent strategy to avoid addiction.</p>
                        <p>However, addiction is not a problem which has only one cause. It's a multidimensional problem. It's a combination of physiological, physical, and also other sociological problem. Help from professional is needed for that case.</p>

                    <div class="collapsible-body">
                        <p>We also believe that social interaction is one of the basic fundamental of education. But for some of us, we can't go to school or any alternative education. In fact, based on UNESCO report, more than 262 million kids and youth around the globe is not going to school and more than 600 million is going to school but the education is not effective.</p>
                        <p>For the brick-and-mortar classroom, tech solution can be used to enhance the learning process. But for some kids and youth who can't accessing that due to a lot of reason (economical, culture, politics, etc), this is one of the feasible solution for them, and also the easiest rather dan building more schools or teaches more teachers.</p>

                        <p>Right now, mobile chat application is massively used by a lot of youth and kids around the globe. So the effort of switching is quite minimum for this case. Beside of that, the usage of chatbot is scientifically proven that it can improve the internal motivation of students and also the learning outcome as well.</p>
                        <p>Internal motivation of learning is one of the basic fundamental that we need to become a lifelong learner. So the main goal is actually to make them learn and learn more from multiple learning resource. Chatbot is only the triggering tools.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>The learning engagement and motivation</strong>
                                <p>Multiple research shows that "fun" in learning is increasing the engagement and motivation to learn. These are important point so their learning process would be more effective and also helps them as a lifelong learner.</p>

                                <p>By utilizing chatbot, like it or not, the students will use their language ability such as reading and writing skill when communicating with the bot. And some research also found that some students use the chatbot to express their language ability confidently.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Personalized Learning</strong>
                                <p>The disadvantage of classroom setting learning is you giving the same treatment to all of the student in the same classroom. By using a chatbot in a personal mode, the learning experience that the learner is personalized based on their ability and condition.However, personalized learning is not always the good solution since it's minimize social interaction between peers. We can set up the chatbot in a group/chatgroup settings so they can learn together and also keeping the social interaction</p>

                    <div class="collapsible-body">
                        <p>So every implementation of educational technology tools needs a strategy to avoid side effect like an addiction. Some of the best practice tells us that using time limitation (e.g. the chatbot is only available at a specific time range) would help the learner to focus on learning and also an excellent strategy to avoid addiction.</p>
                        <p>However, addiction is not a problem which has only one cause. It's a multidimensional problem. It's a combination of physiological, physical, and also other sociological problem. Help from professional is needed for that case.</p>

And also it will means for your constituent that don't have access to quality education or can't go to school for a lot of reason.
