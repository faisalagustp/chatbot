<h1>Why you should think that learning with a chatbot is a future</h1>
Hello, my name is Betty. I want to convince you that chatbot is really the future of learning. Who are you?

# telling why learning should be fun.
Sometimes, we think that education and learning should be a rigorous and intense process to make no one left behind. Based on tens of empirical research, that process does nothing positive to the learner, and it makes them go away from wanting to learn or even dropping out from learning.
It's our responsibility as the educator to making sure that no one left behind, but also pay attention to learning sustainability. We need to change our goal of the learning process, not only focusing on the hard skills but also engage them to learn more independently. By using this approach, it's scientifically proven that the learner' motivation to learn would be improved.

# Why chatbot?
A chatbot is not the only way to make your student more engaged in the learning process. There are many other options to make learning fun. Using chatbot is one of those options.
But here is a thing. Right now, the penetration of internet is growing, and more people have a or more smartphones. More and more people, including your learners/students, are using a smartphone to help their daily activities. This trend is also happening in chatting apps.

Based on this, since your learner is already adapting to use chat platform, it's easier to shift their focus to start learning using it. So the next phase is how to get a good quality chatbot for your learner.
